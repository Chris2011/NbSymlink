    <h1>NbSymlink</h1>\n\n<div>\n    <p>\n        With this plugin, it is very easy to create symlinks right inside netbeans.\n        \
    You don't need a shell, you only need your IDE.\n    \
    </p>\n\n    <div>\n        Right click on a folder/project, go to <strong>Create Symlink</strong> and choose <strong>Folder is source</strong>\n        or <strong>Folder is target</strong>. \
    So you can say I want a symlink for my Project to another folder or\n        this project folder should be my target for another folder.\n    \
    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>See how it works</h3>\n<img src="/screenshots/NbSymlink.gif?\
