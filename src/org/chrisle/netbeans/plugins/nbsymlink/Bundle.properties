    <h1>NbSymlink</h1>\n\n<div>\n    <p>\n        With this plugin, it is very easy to create symlinks right inside netbeans.\n        \
    You don't need a shell, you only need your IDE.\n    \
    </p>\n\n    <div>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Right click on a folder/project</li>\n            <li>go to <strong>Create Symlink</strong></li>\n            <li>choose <strong>Folder is source</strong> or <strong>Folder is target</strong></li>\n            <li>add a name to the target folder, because the name what is inside the field, was already given.\
    </li>\n        </ul>\n        So you can say I want a symlink for my Project to another folder or this project folder should be my target for another folder.\n    \
    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>See how it works</h3>\n<img src="/screenshots/NbSymlink.gif?\
