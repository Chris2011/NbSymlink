# NbSymlink

With this plugin, it is very easy to create symlinks right inside netbeans.
You don't need a shell, you only need your IDE.

Right click on a folder/project, go to <strong>Create Symlink</strong> and choose <strong>Folder is source</strong>
or <strong>Folder is target</strong>. So you can say I want a symlink for my Project to another folder or
this project folder should be my target for another folder.
