<h1>NbSymlink</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        With this plugin, it is very easy to create symlinks right inside netbeans.
        You don't need a shell, you only need your IDE.
    </p>

    <div>
        Right click on a folder/project, go to <strong>Create Symlink</strong> and choose <strong>Folder is source</strong>
        or <strong>Folder is target</strong>. So you can say I want a symlink for my Project to another folder or
        this project folder should be my target for another folder.
    </div>
