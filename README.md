<h1>NbSymlink</h1>

<div>
    <p>
        With this plugin, it is very easy to create symlinks right inside netbeans.
        You don't need a shell, you only need your IDE.
    </p>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Right click on a folder/project</li>
            <li>go to <strong>Create Symlink</strong></li>
            <li>choose <strong>Folder is source</strong> or <strong>Folder is target</strong></li>
            <li>add a name to the target folder, because the name what is inside the field, was already given.</li>
        </ul>
        So you can say I want a symlink for my Project to another folder or this project folder should be my target for another folder.
    </div>
